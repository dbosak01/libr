The **libr** package brings the concepts of data libraries, data 
dictionaries, and data steps to R.  A data library is an object used to define 
and manage an entire directory of data files.  A data dictionary is a data 
frame full of information about a data library, data frame, or tibble. A
data step is a mechanism to perform row-by-row processing of data.
