datastep(
  data,
  steps,
  keep = NULL,

  calculate = NULL,
  retain = NULL,
  attrib = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data to step through.}

\item{steps}{The operations to perform on the data.  This parameter is 
typically specified as a set of R statements contained within 
curly braces.}

\item{keep}{A vector of quoted variable names to keep in the output
data set. By default, all variables are kept.}

\item{drop}{A vector of quoted variable names to drop from the output
data set. By default, no variables are dropped.}

\item{rename}{A named vector of quoted variables to rename.  The current
variable name should be on the left hand side of the name/value pair,
and the new variable name should be on the right.  The rename operation
is performed after the data step, the keep, and the drop.  Therefore, 
the data steps should use the input variable name.  By default, all variables
retain their original names.}

\item{by}{A vector of quoted variable names to use for by-group processing.
This parameter will activate the \code{first.} and \code{last.} automatic
variables, that indicate the first or last rows in a group.  These 
automatic variables are useful for conditional processing on groups.}

\item{calculate}{Steps to set up calculated variables.
Calculated variables are commonly generated with summary functions such as
\code{mean}, \code{median}, \code{min}, \code{max}, etc.  It is more 
efficient to set up calculated variables with the calculate parameter and then 
use those variables in the data step, rather than perform the summary
function inside the data step.  The calculate block will be executed 
immediately before the data step.}

\item{retain}{A list of variable names and initial values 
to retain.  Retained variables will begin the data step with the initial
value.  Then for each iteration of the data step, the variable will
be populated with the ending value from the previous step.  The retain
functionality allows you to perform cumulative operations or decisions
based on the value of the previous iteration of the data step.  Initial 
values should be of the expected data type for the column.  For example, 
for a numeric column set the initial value to a zero, and for a
character column, set the initial value to an empty string, i.e.
\code{retain = list(col1 = 0, col2 = "")}.  There is no default initial 
value for a variable.  You must supply an initial value for each retained
variable.}

\item{attrib}{A named list of attributes.  The list can be either
\code{\link{dsattr}} objects or single default values.  The \code{dsattr}
object allows you to set more attributes on each column.  The 
single default value is convenient if you simply want to create a variable.
By default, variables will be created on the fly with no attributes.}

\item{arrays}{A named list of \code{\link{dsarray}} objects. The 
\code{dsarray} is a list of columns which you can 
iterate over inside the data step.  You can iterate over a \code{dsarray}
either with a \code{for} loop, or with a vectorized function. 
The default value of the \code{arrays} parameter is NULL, meaning
no arrays are defined.}

\item{sort_check}{Checks to see if the input data is sorted according to
the \code{by} variable parameter.  The sort check will give an error
if the input data is not sorted according to the \code{by} variable.
The check is turned on if the value of 
\code{sort_check} is TRUE, and turned off if FALSE.  The default value
is TRUE.  Turn the sort check off if you want to perform by-group 
processing on unsorted data, or data that is not sorted according
to the by-group.}
}
\value{
The processed data frame, tibble, or data table.
}
\description{
The \code{datastep} function allows you to perform
row-wise conditional processing on a data frame, data table, or tibble. 
The function
contains parameters to drop, keep, or rename variables, perform
by-group processing, and perform row-wise or column-wise calculations.
}
\details{
Two parameters on the \code{datastep} function are required: 
\strong{data} and \strong{steps}.  The \strong{data} parameter is
the input data to the data step.  The \strong{steps} parameter contains
the code statements you want to apply to the data. The \strong{steps}
should be wrapped in curly braces.  When running, the data step
will loop through the input data row-by-row, and execute the steps for 
each row.  Variables inside the data step can be accessed using 
non-standard evaluation (meaning they  do not have to be quoted).

Note that the data step is pipe-friendly.  It can be used within 
a \strong{dplyr} pipeline.  The data step allows you to perform
deeply nested and complex conditionals within the pipeline.  The data
step is also very readable compared to other pipeline conditionals.
}
\section{Automatic Variables}{

The \code{datastep} function provides five automatic variables. These 
variables are generated for every data step, and can 
be accessed at any point within the data step: 
\itemize{
  \item{\strong{data}: Represents the entire input data frame.}
  \item{\strong{rw}: Represents the current row.}
  \item{\strong{n.}: Contains the row number.}
  \item{\strong{first.}: Indicates the beginning of a by-group.}
  \item{\strong{last.}: Indicates the end of a by-group.}
}
Automatic variables will be dropped from the data frame at the end
of the data step.  If you wish to keep the automatic variable values,
assign the automatic variable to a new variable and keep that variable.
}

\section{Column Attributes}{

To set attributes for a column on your data, use the \code{attrib}
parameter.  Example attributes include 'label', 'description', 
and 'format'.  These types of attributes are set using a named list and a 
\code{\link{dsattr}} object. The name of the list item
is the column name you want to set attributes on. 
The value of the list item is the \code{dsattr} object.
For a complete list of available attributes, 
see the \code{\link{dsattr}} documentation.

It should be mentioned  that the \code{dsattr} object is not required.  
You can also set attributes with a name and a default value.  
The default value can be any valid data value, such as a number or string.
}

\section{Optional Parameters}{

Optional parameters on the \code{datastep} allow you to shape 
the output dataset or enhance the operation of the \code{datastep}.  Some
parameters are classified as input parameters, and others as output 
parameters.  Input parameters modify the data before the data step
operations takes place.  Output parameters operate on the data
after the data step.

The \code{keep}, \code{drop}, and \code{rename} parameters
are output parameters.  These parameters will be applied after the
data step statements are executed.  Therefore, within the data step, 
refer to variables using the input variable name. New variables may 
be created on the fly, just by assigning a value to the new
variable name.

The \code{keep}, \code{drop}, and \code{rename} parameters require 
quoted variable names, as the variables may not yet exist at the 
time they are passed into the function.  Within a data step or 
calculate block, however, 
variable names do not need to be quoted. 

The \code{calculate} parameter is used to perform vectorized functions
on the data prior to executing the data step.  For example, you 
may want to determine a mean for a variable in the \code{calculate}
block, and then make decisions on that mean in the data step block. 

The \code{retain} parameter allows you to access the prior row value.
At the start of the data step, the retained variable is seeded with the 
initial value. For each subsequent step, the variable is seeded with the
value of the prior step/row.  This functionality allows you to increment 
values or perform cumulative operations.

\code{calculate} and \code{retain} are both input parameters.
}

\section{Data Step Arrays}{

There are times you may want to iterate over columns in your data step.  Such 
iteration is particularly useful when you have a wide dataset,
and wish to perform the same operation on several columns.
For instance, you may want to calculate the mean for 10 different
variables on your dataset.

The \code{arrays} parameter allows you to iterate across columns.  
This parameter accepts a named list of 
\code{\link{dsarray}} objects.  The \code{dsarray} is essentially
a list of columns.  You can use a \code{for} loop to iterate over the
\code{dsarray}, and also send it into a vectorized function.  Data 
step arrays allow to you to perform row-wise calculations. 
For instance, you can calculate 
a sum or mean by row for the variables in your array.
}

\section{Output Column Order}{

By default, the data step will retain the column order of any variables that
already exist on the input data set. New variables created 
in a data step will be appended to the right of existing variables.  
Yet these new variables can sometimes appear in an order that is 
unexpected or undesirable.  

There are two ways to control the order of output columns:
the \code{keep} parameter and the \code{attrib} parameter.

Columns names included on the 
\code{keep} parameter will appear in the order indicated on the keep
vector.  This ordering mechanism is appropriate when you have a small
number of columns and can easily pass the entire keep list.

To control the order of new variables only, use the \code{attrib} parameter.
New variables for which attributes are defined will appear in the 
order indicated on the \code{attrib} list.  The \code{attrib} list
is useful when you are adding a relatively small number of columns to 
an existing data set, and don't want to pass all the column names. 

Remember
that you can supply an attribute list with default values only,
such as \code{attrib = list(column1 = 0, column2 = "")}.  This style of 
attribute definition is convenient if you are only trying to control
the order of columns.

If the above two mechanisms to control column order are not sufficient,
use the data frame subset operators or column ordering functions 
provided by other packages.
}

\section{Datastep Performance}{

The \code{datastep} is intended to be used on small and medium-sized 
datasets.  It is not recommended for large datasets.
If your dataset is greater than one million rows, you should consider
other techniques for processing your data.  While there is no 
built-in restriction on the number of rows, performance of the
\code{datastep} can become unacceptable with a large number of rows.
