\description{
The \code{lib_sync} function synchronizes the data
loaded into the global environment with the data frames stored 
in the data library object.  This synchronization is necessary only
for libraries that have been loaded into the global environment.
The function is used internally to the \strong{libr} package, but 
may be useful to package users in some situations.
