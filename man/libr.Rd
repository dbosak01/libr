\title{Create Libnames and Data Dictionaries}
\description{
The \strong{libr} package contains functions to create data
libraries (libnames) and data dictionaries.  The functions were intentionally
written to provide a way of manipulating data that is familiar to users of  
SASÂ® software.  

The package includes two main functions: \code{\link{libname}} and 
\code{\link{dictionary}}.  The package also provides numerous secondary 
functions for manipulating, accessing, and printing those objects.
