### Introduction <img src="./man/images/libr1.png" align="right" height="138" />

Here is the introduction for libr.

### Installation

The easiest way to install the **sassy** system is to run the following 
command from your R console:

    install.packages("sassy")


Then put the following line at the top of your script:

    library(sassy)


That's it!

The above commands will install and load a set of packages that will allow you
to think about programming in R very much the same way you thought about
programming in SAS®.  

It is not *identical* to SAS®.  R is, after all, 
a very different language.  R is functional, vector-based, and runs
entirely in memory.  As a result, the syntax of **sassy** functions will be 
different than their corresponding SAS® functions.  

The **sassy** functions 
will, however, have a similar feel.  Overall, you will find 
programming with the **sassy** system much more comfortable than programming
in **Base R** or **tidyverse** alone.

### Getting Help

If you need help with the **sassy** family of packages, the best place 
to turn to is the [r-sassy](http://www.r-sassy.org) web site.  
This web site offers many examples, and full
documentation on every function.  

If you need additional help, please turn 
to [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).  The stackoverflow 
community will be very willing to answer your questions.  

### Next Steps

Next, you should read the [Get started](http://sassy.r-sassy.org/articles/sassy.html)
page, and look at some examples.  From these pages, you will be able to 
link into each of the packages included in the **sassy** system, and explore them
in depth.
